       " 'mean-score': 'Unlike most horror movies these days, this film is not a garbage jump scare heavy or-stay up all night terrified-kind of film. A much more thought provoking and overall entertaining film with a nice twist.   Really stupid movie honestly. The lead actress did her best, acted well. \"Get out\" got to his head and tried making this movie smarter than what it should be. Way too predictable just like his last film.   It was rather a suspense than a horror.   Garbage recycled stuff like get out.not impressed again sorry Peele.   This movie sucked! Jordan Peele\\'s first movie Get Out was great! If you\\'re hoping to see something like Get Out this ISN\\'T IT. Maybe I missed something but I really didn\\'t like it. But oh well, maybe next movie he\\'ll hit the mark.   \"Us\" is an ambitiously intriguing horror film that touches upon complex themes to ponder upon, has sharp direction from Jordan Peele and a remarkable performance from Lupita Nyong\\'o.   \"Us\" is a movie with great suspense and a good balance in comedy.   This was definitely the worse film I\\'ve seen in a LONG time; possibly the worst film I\\'ve EVER seen. I thought this was meant to be a spoof on horror films and I commend Peele for creating the first in that genre that was neither funny, nor scary.   Us is going to be one of the best movies of the year. The story is bats*** crazy , Lupita Nyong\\'o is amazing , the tone is dark , and the movie is just amazing.   OK, I just didn\\'t get this movie.   Seemed a little rushed to get to the ending   The movie feels rushed and dragged out at the same time. If you are expecting a horror movie skip this one. The movie did not meet the expectations that i had once i saw the previews.   There goes Jordan Peele again, making the wheels turn well after the film is finished.   Great movie. I mean, who thinks of centering the entire soundtrack after one song. The only downside that I saw about this movie is that there were a lot of untied ends that didn\\'t really make sense. This is very much unlike get out, where most of our questions were answered. This was a dealbreaker for some, between being a great movie, and a bad one, but if you\\'re able to get past the inconclusiveness of the movie, this is one you\\'ll want to see again and again.   Horrible movie. Don\\'t even know how this became a movie This movie is completely pointless. The acting is very mediocre, and the movie would be better served being about 50% as long as it was. I was left completely deflated walking out of the movie theater and so were almost everyone else that watched the movie. Terrible, terrible movie.   Us cements Jordan Peele\\'s horror title. The film certainly is worthy of many viewings. The tone of horror this film conveys is of a classic 80s horror slasher film. The score is brilliant and will be recognizable for horror fans forever. The film has many deep rooted messages behind the surface that could not be more relevant. Overall Us is not only a work of art, a work of philosophy, work of horror and fear but it is a heavy peice of political and social satire. Us is a gift to the horror genre and film.   More of a comedy than a horror.   Us is a amazing and truly scary horror movie. Unlike most horror movies the scares aren\\'t jump scares.   this movie was so disjointed and absurd. I went because the hype made it sound like a horror flick but it became a parody of a horror flick based on a concept better suited for a Black Mirror plot.   Great thinker, loved the soundtrack and also funny, an epic movie.   If the jumping-off point for your movie is \"The American government made clones of everyone and put them in the sewers,\" maybe you shouldn\\'t make the movie.   I would have given it worse review but it started out so well and the lead\\'s performance was just astounding. I don\\'t understand why people are sweating this film maker.   Horrible movie. It serms like the only purpose of this movie is to generate highest amounr of tension and discomfort possible. There is very little value to be obtained from this movie.   Innovative psychological thriller from the master of horror, Jordan Peele.   A very creepy and scary horror movie brimming with ideas which will populate your mind with thoughts that won\\'t leave you alone.   this movie keeps you on the edge of you seat through out the entire film. the only problem with the film is that it does not stick the landing.   An allegory filled mess that lets critics feel like they are clever for \"getting it\". I like Jordan Peele but this was a very over-hyped awful movie. if one girl could make it up the down escalator why couldn\\'t anyone else? There are so many unexplained parts to this movie...I give it an F-...   # of Times Seen: 2When: Mar 22nd; Mar 29thUS is a pretty interesting film with a very interesting premise: a regular American family has a family of doppelganger who want to kill them and take their place. The true motives of the family doesn\\'t become more apparent until towards the end of the film (and I won\\'t spoil any of it for you) but this motive will keep you in suspense and entertained until that plot twist arrives.The tone and the performance by all cast members were solid. The only main issue I had was that there weren\\'t that many scare parts to the film and the movie was advertised as a \"horror film.\" Although, this is easily forgivable, because the film makes up for everything else.Rating: 4/5 stars.Would Recommend The whole movie seemed littered with plot holes or maybe it\\'s just me. Many audience were leaving even before the movie ended.   A movie requiring your attention and ability to critically think of you really want to understand it. Instances of true tension, well executed. The film has outstanding performances, conceptually bizarre (referencing the Heavens Gate cult phenomenon) and includes the kind of character story arc, gallows humor, sunny holiday scenery and bloody violence that only an exceptional indie/auteur film could provide. It\\'s not as unified, or instantly \\'classic\\' as the move Get Out, but US, as a film, has it\\'s own identity and goes off into convincing, fresh territory in it\\'s own right. A fundamental theme to the movie is social inequality, but also just as a cryptic, bizarre independent movie, it\\'s a compelling, frequently disturbing fantasy. It\\'s part cult thriller, part horror also, so a fair few jump cuts and so on. Wish mainstream cinema would put more faith in original, conceptual work like Jordan Peele films, and less franchise work.   The movie really starts off with a bang but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. I enjoyed the twist ending of the movie but even with those twists it left a lot of questions that left answers I am not sure could be thoroughly answered. In the case of \"US\" you get a little bit of both. When the horror aspect kicks in you\\'ll be biting your nails with wide eyes. The entire movie will leave you asking questions. This is not your standard horror flick. Where most horror films tend to fail, \\'US\\' pulls ahead. Many horror films throw the story right in your face and use cheap jump scares and the occasional plot twist to keep you watching. Instead, \\'US\\' manages to keep the plot very straight forward, while being a mystery, it uses standard horror film situations but fills them with tension in just the right way. So if you\\'re looking for some intelligent breakdown of the meaning behind the film, this isn\\'t the review for you. However, if I was to \"walk the plank\" as it were to give my opinion, I like to think that this film speaks about how we are often our own worst enemies. It\\'s become a bit of a trend in horror films as of late were they don\\'t take themselves seriously and as a member of the audience we\\'re unable to take the film seriously. If they\\'re not taking the film seriously, they\\'re overacting to the point that it almost becomes comedic. Lupita Nyong\\'o absolutely killed it in this film. Everything you do is always done so well. There was points in the film where I was genuinely concerned for these children and had to remind myself it was just a film. If you\\'re looking for a solid horror film that will play with your mind and your heart, this is a great place to start. It will be a bit difficult for other horror films to compete with \\'US\\' this year.   Two years ago, writer/director Jordan Peele shocked and delighted audiences with Get Out, one of the smartest, funniest, and most culturally relevant horror movies ever to grace the screen. Now we have his sophomore outing, Us, and clearly he hasn\\'t lost his touch.As horror, Us is brilliant. This is graphicly, viscerally violent stuff, yet the real horror is on the psychological level. The idea that everyone you know may well be dead and replaced. The horror of having to kill yourself, and whether that means a part of you dies in the process. Lupita Nyong\\'o deserves special praise for her performance Adelaide and Red, which makes her both one of the most badass scream queens and terrifying monsters in recent years. And placing both sets of characters in the same shots, brutally struggling to kill each other, is an absolute technical triumph, one that transcends the level of mere effects.There\\'s not as much humor this time, but what\\'s there is deeply relatable to anyone who\\'s been on a family vacation or had kids, and frequently quite hilarious. Even more impressive is the degree which it\\'s interwoven with the horror. And not since Shaun of the Dead has the bickering between people caught in a horror movie been this funny. There are some very interesting musical choices as well. After watching this movie, it will be hard to ever look at Good Vibrations the same again. There are bits that feel like they could be allegories for any number of different cultural/political issues, but none of them really go anywhere. And the references to Hands Across America must be symbolic of something, but if the director knows he\\'s not telling us. But it is very much about guilt, paranoia, repressed trauma, and facing the darkness within yourself, which are certainly worthy ideas for a horror movie.Ultimately, Peele may or may not have met the bar he set two years ago with his directorial debut.   I don\\'t do horror movies. So I was totally sceptical about this film. My son dragged me to the theater for this one.   Us is hard to understand, but once you figure all the symbolism and riddles, you will find yourself have watch one of the best horror/thrillers of the decade Unlike Get Out, the comedy and horror here do not coexist symbiotically, but rather undermine one another, making the movie feel tone-deaf and ineffective. The horror is largely clichÃ (C), and what is original is untenable nonsense, as is revealed in the final act\\'s floundering attempts to explain itself that only raise more questions. In many ways Us feels like two or three different scripts were hastily combined -- a more restrained and deliberate exploration of the same themes here could have been amazing. Though there is a lot of symbolism and reference throughout the film, in the end it fails to say anything meaningful at all.   From white demons to inner demons writer/director Jordan Peele has created a niche for himself as THE filmmaker of psychological horror and drama. \"Get Out\", his debut film from 2017 was the sleeper hit of that year, but his latest movie, \"Us\", doesn\\'t pack enough punch to be terrifying in any way, no matter what the trailer would make you think. It is shocking to realize that the strangers look like Adelaide and her familyâ\"but their menace makes it clear they want to cause a lot of harm.Without giving anything else away the best thing \"Us\" does is not settle for cheap thrills and pointless scare gags like so many horror films do these days. Peele\\'s thinking man\\'s approach serves him well, relying on double-edged characterizations already perfected with \"Get Out\".The cast is fineâ\"especially the kidsâ\"with their effortless ability to play both sides of a coin and keep it exciting.'}"
